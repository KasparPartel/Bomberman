## Description
Pure HTML/JS/CSS, no canvas.
Runs smoothly on Chrome and Firefox, we used a throttled requestAnimationframe
game loop to make it run the same speed on 60hz and 144 hz screens.

## Usage
- Just use Live Server (or any similar method) on ./src/index.html
(localhost:5500/src in your browser)

Have fun!
